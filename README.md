# Electric-Vehicles
I built a Power BI Report that shows an Overview of Electric Cars across US between 2010 and 2023. I built this report based on a guided project from YouTube Channel 'Data Tutorials', [Power BI Report_Electric_Cars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjjt87YoOMg&amp;t=45s)
I built Power BI report just by looking at how it looks in the video. It was a great practice for me. 
I also ran a few SQL queries to compare results in Power BI so that I can be sure data in the Dashboard is correct. 

Data for the report was taken from [kaggle website](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/willianoliveiragibin/electric-vehicle-population/code)
